# Customer Churn Prediction
## Introduction
Churn or customer attrition is when customers choose to stop using the services of a particular business. 

Churn rate is very important in the telecommunications industry due to the competition between the variety of service providers. Every year companies try to understand trends within their churn rates to limit the probability of the churn by improving customer-business relations. These companies also try to predict when a customer is going to discontinue the service, so they can focus on customer retention marketing for the subset of the population that is most likely to churn.

In this project the demographic of the churn population is explored in context of the whole and logistic regression is used to build a classification model to predict customer attrition.
